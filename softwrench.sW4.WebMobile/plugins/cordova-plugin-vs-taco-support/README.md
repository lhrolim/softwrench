Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova (TACo) Cordova CLI Support Plugin
===============
**Note: This plugin no longer includes support for executing Task Runner Explorer bindings from the command line. Check out [this repository](https://github.com/Chuxel/taco-tricks/tree/master/hook-task-runner-binding) for how to use a Cordova project "hook" to accomplish the same thing.**

This is a sample Cordova plugin designed to add in support three two Visual Studio [Tools for Apache Cordova](http://aka.ms/cordova) features along with number of workarounds for Cordova issues such that they work with the standard Cordova CLI and deriviatives like the Ionic CLI or PhoneGap CLI. Specifically:

- Support for the VS res/native folder structure 
- Support for VS specific config.xml elements for Windows packaging
- Removing bad plugin related json files when associated platforms folder is not present
- Fixing symlinks for iOS custom frameworks inside plugins as needed
- Fixing missing execute bits on Cordova platform scripts on OSX as needed

The plugin can also be safely installed and used with Visual Studio projects as the plugin does not interfere with normal operation.

##Installation
Note: Cordova 5.1.1 has a bug that can cause plugins installed from a Git repo to fail if the project is on a different drive than your temp folder. Either move the project to the same drive when installing or you can instead download a copy, unzip it, and add the plugin from the filesystem.

From Visual Studio:

1. Open the config.xml designer by double clicking on the file
2. Select the "Plugins" > "Custom"
3. Select "Git"
3. Enter in "https://github.com/Chuxel/taco-cordova-support-plugin.git" and press the arrow
4. Click "Add"


From the command line:

1. Install the Cordova CLI
2. Navigate to your project root
3. Type "cordova plugin add https://github.com/Chuxel/taco-cordova-support-plugin.git"
