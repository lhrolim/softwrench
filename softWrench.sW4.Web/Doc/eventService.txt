TODO: Add high level description for event_service.js

FUNCTION: beforesubmit.prevalidation & beforesubmit.postvalidation
Works as a normal custom service method where we can calculate/transform
data, however, there is support to call a confirmation alert in either
the prevalidation or postvalidation method. The only requirement to
using the event as a confirmation is that you must return false from the
custom service (or return alert.confirm, which will return a false by
default), and in the success function you will need to call
parameters.continue();

EX:
return alertService.confirm(null, null, function () {
parameters.continue();
}, "Are you sure you want to accept?");

FUNCTION: beforesubmit.onvalidation
Attaches to a custom service/method
reference and appends the array of strings to the red validation error
banner. This occurs during the creation or update of a record.
