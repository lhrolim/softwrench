The scanner detection service is used to initialize scanner detection for the 
jQuery.scanerdetection.js by setting a function to call when the jQuery 
plugin detects a barcode scan.

The inventory grid for example uses initInventoryGridListener(). The function 
reads a scan order (list of properties to be filled and the order in which 
to fill them) from the context. It then loops through the scan order and checks 
the datamap to see if the properties currently have a value. When the loop 
finds a property from the scan order that does not have a value in the datamap,
the property in the datamap is set to the scanned value.
